<h1>The Best Movies According to Chris</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The God-father</h3>
<p>Amazing soundtrack, setting, acting, plot, everything about this movie makes it one of the greatest films of all time.</p>
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>This was my first actual interaction with japanese cinema and animation. I remember crying as a little kid, a wild emotional ride from beginning to end. Fell in love with the world and its characters.</p>
<h3>Spotlight</h3>
<p>This film opened my eyes to how hypocritical the world can be. It showed me how you cannot accept some views because it is the norm.</p>
